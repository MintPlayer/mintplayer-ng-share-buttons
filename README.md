## Installation
### Advanced router

    npm i @mintplayer/ng-router
    
### Share buttons

    npm i @mintplayer/ng-share-buttons

This should also install the peerDependencies in your project.

## Components
The share buttons are showcased in the angular app included in the project. You can simply run

    npm start -- --open

to discover them.

There's not yet a showcase for the advanced router with configurable query parameters.

## Discover yourself
Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
Then run following commands

    git clone https://github.com/MintPlayer/mintplayer-ng-share-buttons
    npm i
    npm start -- --open
